# Homework Unit Eight:  Portafolio

# Description of the homework:

In this homework, I created my portafolio and added links to the latest homeworks assigments and  project one assigment. I used the layout on the previous portafolio assigment in homework two, and inproved it using what i have learned so far in class.

The page displays my portafolio. It displays and area "About Me", "Projects", "Works" and "Contact Me". The About Me area, displays information about me. The Projects and Works display cards with the screenshot of the asigment and  title. The pictures inside the cards are hyperlinks to the link deploiment of the assigments. Above the cards there is a link to the repo of the assigment. the contact me information displays the linkedin, github and email information about me. 

In this homework, I used, jQuery, bootstrap, googlefonts and javascript to create my Portafolio.
